[🔱SCAST](https://davidkingzyb.github.io/scast/SCAST.html) is a programmatic tool that converts code into UML diagrams and flowcharts.

support plan
- javascript (use [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn))
- typescript (use [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for now [estree](https://typescript-eslint.io/) later)
- csharp (use a custom parser no longer supported in future)
- python (ues a custom parser use [filbert](https://github.com/differentmatt/filbert) later)
- vue (later)

The underlying principle involves leveraging a parser to parse the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), followed by static analysis, and finally utilizing [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-live-editor) and [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) for visualization.

You can try it [online](https://davidkingzyb.github.io/scast/SCAST.html) or just download this repo and open SCAST.html with browser.
