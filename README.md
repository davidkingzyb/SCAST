**Convert Code to UML and Flow Diagram**

2024/9/27 by DKZ


[ðŸ”±SCAST](https://davidkingzyb.github.io/template/SCAST_TS.html) is a programmatic tool that converts code into UML diagrams and flowcharts.

Only supports code written in TypeScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm for now. 

The underlying principle involves leveraging a TypeScript parser to parse the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), followed by static analysis, and finally utilizing [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-live-editor) and [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) for visualization.

You can try it [online](https://davidkingzyb.github.io/template/SCAST_TS.html) or just download this repo and open SCAST_TS.html with browser.
